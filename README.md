# Phaser/TypeScript/Webpack/Capacitor Starter

A starter template for using Phaser with TypeScript, Webpack, and Capacitor for native iOS and Android builds based on [Joshua Morony work](https://github.com/joshuamorony/phaser3-typescript-webpack-capacitor). We have implemented hot module replacement [+info](https://webpack.js.org/concepts/hot-module-replacement/).
Using this repository will require a working knowledge of Capacitor - you can find documentation [here](https://capacitor.ionicframework.com/docs/) and additional learning resources [here](https://www.joshmorony.com/tag/capacitor/).
